### Local Environment Setup

### New Dependencies to install

`pip install googletrans`

`pip install wikipediaapi`

#### Install Dependencies

`pip install nltk`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install keras`

`pip install tensorflow`

`pip install spacy`

`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

When first running the program, it may ask you to download certain NTLK packages. The only way I found I could download them was by running the code below:

```python
import nltk
import ssl

try:
    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
except AttributeError:
    pass
else:
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

nltk.download()
```

### API Added (Individual Project)

## Google Translate API
The Google Translate API is used to translate any language typed by the user into English so the chatbot can understand the message

## Wikipedia API
The Wikipedia API is utilized such that when the user wants to know something, like depression, the chatbot will return the summary retrieved from the Wikipediaâ€™s page on depression.
